# youtube-channel-id-finder

- Using this web based solution, you can easily get the channel id of a youtube channel using URL/channel Handle name
- This uses Youtube official Api v3 to extract the channel id string from a list of input.
- This needs a youtube api key in order to fetch the data. Api key can be declared directly during the process and hence can change the key upon limit of a key is reached.
